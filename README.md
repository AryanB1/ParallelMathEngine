# ParallelMathEngine

**ParallelMathEngine** is a C++ project that implements a parser and evaluator for arithmetic expressions. It supports variable assignments and uses multithreading to optimize performance.

## Features

- **Arithmetic Expression Parsing**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
- **Variable Assignment**: Allows users to define and use variables in expressions.
- **Multithreaded Evaluation**: Enhances performance by using multithreading for complex expressions.
- **Dynamic Variable Storage**: Real-time storage and retrieval of variables.

## Sample Usage

Enter an arithmetic expression (or type 'exit' to quit): x = (3 + (2 * 4))

Variable assigned successfully!

Enter an arithmetic expression (or type 'exit' to quit): y = (x * 2)

Variable assigned successfully!

Enter an arithmetic expression (or type 'exit' to quit): y

Result: 22
